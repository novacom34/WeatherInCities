It's a simple application for displaying weather in different cities.
Implemented using the MVP architecture.
To provide support and enhance the functionality, the application is divided by modules. Currently there is only one module but you can easily add the another.
`ApplicationRouter` is the main object that is responsible for routing between modules.
Each module consists of the following components:
- `Model`
- `ViewController`
- `Presenter`
- `Module Router` (responsible for routing inside the module)
